        Hi! I'm Irina Yakovich.
        <br>
        <br>A results-driven, customer-focused, analytical software engineer with 10+ years of successful experience in the full life cycle of the software development.
         I strongly believe that software development should accommodate the latest techniques and practices.
        <br>
        <br>I participated in various business-critical projects related to extracting and managing data from different sources,
        familiar with both SQL and No-SQL databases, modern client-side frameworks, microservice architecture and Kubernetes.
        <br>
        <br>I have a significant and proven experience in leading software development teams and I enjoy motivating and
        guiding my team members.
        <br>
        <br>Since 2014 I have been a <a href="#certifications">professional scrum master</a> and helped in
        setting up, running and professionalizing multiple scrum teams.
        <br>

        <br>I do strongly believe in the majority of the funny sounding software related abbreviations such
        as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">KISS</a> as well as in <a
            href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">the Agile Manifesto</a>.
        <br>
        <br>I am always open to meeting new people and exploring possibilities so do not hesitate to contact
        me through one of <a href="#social">the social networks</a>.
