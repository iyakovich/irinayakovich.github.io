    <p>
        I'm Irina Yakovich, a results-driven software engineer with over 10 years of experience delivering scalable, high-quality solutions across the full software development lifecycle. 
        I specialize in modern software architecture, clean code practices, and end-to-end system delivery.

        <br>I approach engineering challenges with a pragmatic, platform-agnostic mindset, selecting the best tools and technologies to solve real-world problems. 
        My core expertise includes SQL and NoSQL databases, microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and test automation. 
        I have a strong passion for containerization, infrastructure-as-code, and building reliable, maintainable systems.
        <br>
        <br>In addition to my technical skills, I bring a proven track record of leading cross-functional teams, fostering engineering excellence, and mentoring developers.
        As a certified <a href="#certifications">Professional Scrum Master</a> since 2016, I have consistently delivered mission-critical projects on time, while cultivating agile best practices and exceeding stakeholder expectations.
